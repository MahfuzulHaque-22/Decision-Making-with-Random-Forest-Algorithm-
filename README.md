# Decision-Making-with-Random-Forest-Algorithm-



In this example, the program loads a dataset from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, and splits it into training and testing sets. It then trains a random forest classifier and a convolutional neural network on the training set, evaluates both models on the testing set, and makes a decision based on which model has the highest accuracy
